## Development

### Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20
> - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 10

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalisio/{{ name }}.git
cd {{ name }}

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Linting

```bash
# Lint all packages
pnpm lint

# Lint a specific package
pnpm lint:<package>
```

> [!NOTE]
> **{{ name }}** follows the [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/) style guide for linting and code consistency.
> By default, **standard** is called with the `--fix` option to automatically fix style issues before committing.

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for a specific package
pnpm test:<package>

# Run a single test file
pnpm vitest run --project <package> <file>.test.js
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, **vitest** is called with the `--coverage` option to automatically compute the coverage.
> Coverage reports are generated using [v8](https://v8.dev/blog/javascript-code-coverage) provider.

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm -r build

# Build a specific package
pnpm --filter @kalisio/<package> build
```

### committing

{{ name }} follows the [Conventional commits specifications](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
which provides a set of rules to make commit messages more readable when looking through the project history.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>[optional `breaking`]
```

Where `type` must be one of the following:
* `build`: changes that affect the build system (external dependencies)
* `ci`: changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
* `chore`: changes that affect the project structure
* `docs`: changes that affect the documentation only
* `feat`: a new feature
* `fix`: a bug fix
* `perf`: a code change that improves performance
* `refactor`: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `revert`: revert changes
* `style`: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (lint issues)
* `test`: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `wip`: temporary commits for work in progress

### Versioning

We rely on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning a release. Indeed, given a version number
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
* `MAJOR` version when you make a major evolution leading to breaking changes,
* `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* `PATCH` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

### Publishing

_TODO_

## Submission

### Report a bug

Before creating an issue please make sure you have checked out the docs, you might want to also try searching Github.
It's pretty likely someone has already asked a similar question.

Issues can be reported in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kalisio/{{ name }}/issues).

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests and we're continually working to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute.

We prefer small pull requests with minimal code changes. The smaller they are the easier they are to review and merge.
A core team member will pick up your PR and review it as soon as they can. They may ask for changes or reject your
pull request. This is not a reflection of you as an engineer or a person. Please accept feedback graciously as we
will also try to be sensitive when providing it.

Although we generally accept many PRs they can be rejected for many reasons. We will be as transparent as possible
but it may simply be that you do not have the same context or information regarding the roadmap that the core team
members have. We value the time you take to put together any contributions so we pledge to always be respectful of
that time and will try to be as open as possible so that you don't waste it.
